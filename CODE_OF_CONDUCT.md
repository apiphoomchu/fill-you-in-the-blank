# Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the Bangkok CSR Matching Project, we pledge to create and maintain an inclusive, respectful, and harassment-free environment for everyone who contributes or participates in the project.

We are committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, age, ability status, neurodiversity, religion (or lack thereof), or any other aspect of identity and intersectionality.

We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or any form of oppressive behavior. This includes, but is not limited to, verbal or written comments that are derogatory or discriminatory, sexualized comments or images, deliberate intimidation, threats or acts of violence, stalking, or sustained disruption of the project's work.

We encourage all contributors to be respectful, empathetic, and kind to others. We strive to build an inclusive community that values diverse perspectives and experiences.

If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this code of conduct, please notify the project maintainer(s) immediately. All reports will be taken seriously and will be addressed promptly and appropriately.

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by this code of conduct. Failure to comply may result in removal from the project community.

Thank you for helping to create and maintain a positive and welcoming environment for all.
